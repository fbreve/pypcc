- Changed the stop criterion to be less conservative. It now considers the
amount of nodes, the amound of particles and also the amount of k-nearest 
neighbors in the graph construction to calculate how many iterations it 
should wait on the "stable" phase before it stops. k-nearest neighbors gives a
clue on how connected the network is, we usually need less "stable" iterations
in more connected networks.
- Included an option ('early_stop') to turn off the stop criterion. If 
'early_stop' is False, the algorithm will run the number of iterations defined
in 'max_iter'.
- Fixed a bug where the 'es_chk' parameter was being ignored and the default
value ('2000') was always assumed.
